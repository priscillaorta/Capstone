## Eastern University DTSC 691 Capstone Project

This repository contains sql, R, and ipynb files used in the completion of DTSC 691 capstone project. For this project, a database was created utilizing California 
Department of Education's data (cde.ca.gov) to identify factors associated with college going rates and to assess college going rates among different
demographic groups. 

The repository is organized in the following way:
- `All Project Files` contains all files
- `pre_analysis.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook that contains code that pre processes the data to prepare it for import using pgAdmin
- `sql_files` contains sql files containing database and table creation statements, code used to clean and manipulate data, and queries used to provide insights
- `r_files` contains R markdown files that provide a statistical analysis of the data in addition to visualizations created to communicate insights to non-technical audiences
